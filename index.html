      <h2>The Internet's Role ♪</h2>
      <p>
        The internet plays a very important role in allowing you to stream music online. Here is the simplified version of the path your data takes when accessing music online through the Internet.
        The device you are connected to begins by sending a play request to your home router. 
        Following this, your router forwards the request to your ISP network. The ISP network then forwards
        packets to the hub. Once the packets are examined, they are forwarded to
        the edge server. This process is repeated in descending order
        to get your packets back to your home router, which then plays your music on your device!

        Above is a web diagram we created to illustrate and demonstrate the process it takes to listen to music using the internet.

      <h2>Steps in Depth ♪</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Device</strong> – This is your phone, computer, or tablet and it sends a play request when you click "play" on your music application.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Home Router</strong> – This is your Wi-Fi router at home and it forwards your request to the ISP. The router also decodes the packets and plays the music on your device during the <em>return path</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>ISP Network</strong> – Your Internet Service Provider (like AT&T or T-Mobile) receives your request and sends it to a hub.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Hub</strong> – This part of the network infrastructure moves data along the internet. It examines the IP address in the packets and forwards them correctly toward the content server. An example of a hub is The Google Data Center and it hosts multiple servers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>CDN/Edge Server</strong> – A Content Delivery Network stores copies of your music closer to you and sends the requested music data back through the network.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Packets</strong> – Small units of data used to make transportation more manageable and efficient. <em>This is what your "data" is being transformed into during its transmission before reaching its final destination.</em>
      </p>

      <h3>Summary ♪</h3>
      <p>
        The internet plays a large role in transmitting your data, which allows you access your music online. The process is basically a round trip: your device requests music → network moves the request to a server → server sends music back → your device receives it.
